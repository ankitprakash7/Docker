# This project is a multi-tier application running on a single host.
# I have deployed Drupal infrastructure on docker container
#Drupal is a free and open-source content-management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. 
#It is used as a back-end framework for at least 2.1% of all Web sites worldwide ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites including WhiteHouse.gov and data.gov.uk. 
#It is also used for knowledge management and business collaboration.

#I have used mysql as the database and redhat8 as the baseOS
